# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ascend direct path.
#
# Each program owns whole output rows rather than a slice of the flattened
# (n, oh, ow) space, so the inner tl.arange is the output column index and the
# input address ``iw = ow * SW + kw * DW`` is affine in it.  With unit stride
# that is a contiguous load.  Tiling the flattened space -- what the shared
# direct kernels do -- leaves the stride-1 index discontinuous at every row
# boundary, which turns each tap into a vector-indexed gather; the Ascend
# backend charges roughly four orders of magnitude for those, and it showed: the
# same shapes that run in 0.4 ms native took 388 ms.
#
# The address is affine *unpadded* because the padding is materialised instead:
# see _pad_input.  Anything that makes the address non-affine again -- a clamp
# to keep a masked lane in range, say -- costs more than the whole rest of the
# rewrite, which is why the halo is built rather than tested for.
#
# Within that tiling there are two kernels -- one per spatial rank -- and each
# carries both forms: a tl.dot branch and a plain FMA one, selected per call by
# _can_use_dot.
#
# * The tl.dot branch reduces a (BLOCK_C, BLOCK_W) input tile against a
#   (BLOCK_OC, BLOCK_C) weight tile, one dot per tap and channel block.  This is
#   what puts the operator on the cube, and msprof confirms it: the dot kernel
#   reports Task Type=MIX_AIC, while the FMA kernel below reports
#   AI_VECTOR_CORE.  On the 2D core case that is 3.29 ms against 28.0 ms.
#
#   The FMA form is not the more accurate one, which is worth stating plainly
#   because this file previously assumed the opposite.  Against an fp64 CPU
#   reference on (4,64,64,64)/3x3, the dot kernel's error is 1.068e-04 absolute
#   / 9.16e-07 relative -- numerically identical to the vendor conv run with
#   HF32 off, so it is the same exact-fp32 arithmetic, not the cube's
#   reduced-precision mode.  The FMA kernel is 3.052e-05 / 2.62e-07, 3.5x
#   tighter, but that is precision no fp32 tolerance asks for and it costs 3.9x
#   in time.  For scale, the vendor conv with HF32 *on* is 1.694e-02 / 1.45e-04,
#   which is where the ~11-bit-mantissa figure this file used to cite comes
#   from; tl.dot here does not do that.
#
# * The FMA form keeps one tap and one channel per iteration, for the shapes
#   tl.dot cannot express: any tile dimension below 16, i.e. every shape with
#   fewer than 16 output channels per group or fewer than 16 input channels.
#   Those are the small launch-bound cases, where padding up to 16 would
#   multiply a cheap kernel by 16/3.  It is what the two 3D shapes that miss the
#   dot minimum keep: stride 2 leaves an 8-wide output row, and C_in 4 is a
#   4-deep contraction, and both run it as fast as before the 3D arm was fixed.
#
# The dot path also has to fit the unified buffer, which is a correctness limit
# rather than a speed consideration: past it BiShengHIR either aborts the build
# with "ub overflow" or, for a tile that only just overruns, emits a kernel that
# faults the device.  _pick_block_c shrinks the channel tile to fit; the budget
# and the measurement behind it are at _UB_TILE_MAX.
#
# Both read the weight from the transposed (KH, KW, C, OC) layout built by
# _prep_weight.  That is not incidental: the output-channel axis is what the
# inner loop indexes, and it is a gather in the native layout and unit-stride in
# this one -- 140.8 ms against 36.1 ms with the kernel otherwise unchanged.
#
# Turning that tile a quarter turn -- (KH, KW, OC, C), so that the tile's *last*
# axis, the one triton vectors a load along, is the contiguous one -- was tried
# on the strength of a microbenchmark that read the isolated weight load 1.13 to
# 1.40x faster, and reverted.  On the whole call it is a regression: 19 cases
# averaged 0.244 against 0.268, with the FMA shapes losing worst ((2,4,16,16,16)
# 381 us to 2630 us, (8,3,224,224) 617 us to 9285 us) on weight tiles of a few
# dozen elements.  The tile is not what the kernel is waiting on; rewriting the
# addressing around it just moves the compiler's schedule.
#
# Loop nesting differs between the two kernels on purpose.  The 2D kernels are
# tap-major (static kh/kw outside, the channel loop inside); the 3D one is
# channel-major.  A runtime channel loop wrapped around 27 unrolled taps instead
# of 9 sends the Ascend compiler into a multi-minute unroll -- measured stuck
# for > 15 min on (1,16,4,4,4)/3x3x3.  Nine taps is under that limit; twenty-
# seven is not.
#
# For the same reason the 3D kernel's dot arm walks its taps in a *runtime*
# loop: 27 unrolled taps that each hold a tl.dot do not merely compile slowly,
# they hang the device.  On the 3D core case (2,16,16,16,16) bf16 with 16 input
# and 16 output channels -- every tile at tl.dot's minimum size -- a 100-launch
# loop never returned once in four attempts, while the identical loop on the FMA
# kernel finished in 0.5 s and the same 27-tap dot kernel at 1x3x3 (9 taps
# instead of 27) finished normally.  It is the tap count, not the tile size.
# The runtime loop is what makes the arm compile and run at all; see _DOT_3D for
# what it measures now that it is on.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The spatial tile is the inner dimension, so it is chosen first: a whole output
# row when it fits, capped at _BLOCK_W_MAX registers' worth.  The channel tile
# then takes what is left of a fixed accumulator budget.  Both are picked per
# call because the kernel is launch- and mask-bound at the small end of the
# shape range: a fixed BLOCK_W of 256 over a 6-wide output masks 250 lanes away
# and leaves a single program for the whole device.
#
# BLOCK_W is never traded down to buy BLOCK_OC back, which is what this did
# until it was measured -- see _BLOCK_ELEMS.  BLOCK_W has a defect the budget
# does not show: every tap load is a run of BLOCK_W elements, so a wider tile
# buys longer runs and fewer programs at once, and the reduction tile is the one
# that can pay for it.
# Raised from 256 by measurement, because the axis it was trading against is not
# interchangeable with it.  512 is not a tuning preference either: on every 1-D
# shape in the suite it is the whole output row, and the row is what sets the
# length of a load.
_BLOCK_W_MAX = 512
# Ceiling on the output-channel tile.  This is the kernel's throughput knob,
# and the reason is in the loop's shape: one program loads a (BLOCK_C, BLOCK_W)
# input tile and reuses it for BLOCK_OC output channels, so the bytes it must
# pull per MAC are 2 / BLOCK_OC -- the channel tile cancels out of the load
# entirely and the *count of programs* is what BLOCK_OC divides.  The kernel is
# bound on the MTE2 pipe (aic_mte2_ratio 1.000 against a cube at 0.133), so that
# is the load it is bound on.  Measured on (8,256,64,64)/k3, whole call, bf16:
#
#   BLOCK_OC    16     32     64    128    256
#   us        7052   3441   1711    912    917
#
# i.e. exactly 1/BLOCK_OC up to 128 and flat after, so the ceiling is worth
# setting from the budget below rather than at a constant.  It used to be 32,
# which cost this shape 3.8x and capped every case at OC/32 times the loads it
# needed.
_BLOCK_OC_MAX = 256
# Target accumulator size, i.e. BLOCK_OC * BLOCK_W, in elements.  Raised twice
# by measurement, 4096 -> 8192 -> 32768, each time because BLOCK_OC was hitting

#
# The last step is the one that matters, and it is measured on the device rather
# than by wall clock -- these calls are 30 us and the ~73 us host cost of a
# triton launch swamps them:
#
#   (8,256,64,64)/k3   (128, 64) 939 us   (256, 64) 622 us    1.51x
#   (32,64,512)/k3     (64, 128)  18.1 us (512, 64) 12.7 us   1.43x
#
# -- whole call, bf16, device time, where the pair is (BLOCK_OC, BLOCK_W).  Note
# what changed on the second shape: the winning tile is *wider*, not just
# bigger, because BLOCK_C gave up what BLOCK_W took (see _pick_block_c) and the
# budget is exactly conserved.  That is the whole rule here.

# the tile must not exceed 1572864 / 128 = 12288 elements -- which for power-of-
# two tiles means 8192.  Exceeding it is a correctness bound, not a speed knob:
# the worst shapes fail the build with "ub overflow", but a tile that only just
# overruns it, like the 16384-element one on (32,64,210,210)/k5/s1/p1, compiles
# and then faults the device's MTE at runtime.  Shrinking BLOCK_C rather than
# BLOCK_W is the cheaper half: measured 0.545 ms against 0.593 ms on

# It was off because the arm was wrong, and it was wrong in one place: the
# weight tile's channel-reduction offset was missing the ``* w_c_stride`` that
# the 2-D kernel's dot arm carries, so on a (tap, C, OC) weight the tile walked
# the *output-channel* axis where it meant the channel axis.  Three taps of
# looking right is what the old note here described -- "the tap, channel and
# output addressing all read correctly against the 2-D kernel that shares them"
# -- and the error that note records is what the missing factor produces when
# the two axes are both 16 wide.  Measured against an fp64 CPU reference on the
# three shapes that reach the arm, every 3-D shape whose output tile clears
# tl.dot's minimum in all three dimensions:
#
#   (2,16,16,16,16)  k3 s1 g1   rel 1.392  ->  2.403e-03
#   (4,16,24,24,24)  k3 s1 g1   rel 1.397  ->  2.527e-03
#   (2,16,12,12,12)  k3 s1 g16  rel 1.399  ->  2.716e-03
#
# -- the FMA arm's own error is 2.5e-03 on these same shapes, so the arm is not
# merely closer, it is at the same noise floor as every other dot path here.
#
# What turning it on buys, whole call, bf16, gem device time in us:
#
#   [ 5] (2,16,16,16,16)  k3 s1    406  ->  217    1.9x
#   [19] (4,16,24,24,24)  k3 s1   1623  ->  759    2.1x

#   [22] (2, 4,16,16,16)  k3 s1    354  ->  354    1.0x
#
# The two that do not move are the two that never reach the arm: at stride 2 the
# output row is 8 wide, and at C_in 4 the contraction is 4 deep, both under
# tl.dot's minimum, so _can_use_dot keeps them on the FMA arm either way and
# neither pays anything for the arm existing.  Same reason the depthwise lift
# below stays switched on -- it keeps (2,16,12,12,12)/g16 off the BLOCK_OC=1 FMA
# path, and the arm it lifts into is this one, so a 3-D depthwise shape still
# clears tl.dot on the dense weight.

# window expansion done in hardware during the GM->L1 move (its Load3D), so the
# GEMM gets a contraction axis of KH*KW*C_in.  Triton cannot express Load3D, so
# the expansion here is a gather inside the GEMM's A-load -- the tap axis in
# ``iw = ow*SW + kw*DW`` is a per-lane vector-indexed load, and the ``k_off % C``
# / ``k_off // C`` on a *runtime* C are emulated divisions on a 256-wide vector.
# Both are exactly the two ops this backend charges ~4 orders of magnitude for
# (see the note at the top of this file and [[ascend-croslane-op-costs]]).

#
# so the flag stays off.  CANN's default strategy does not transfer to triton
# here: the hardware move that makes im2col+GEMM win for CANN is Load3D, and

# into a (KH*KW*C, M) buffer then a clean GEMM -- is the only way to keep the
# big-K contraction without the gather, and it was not pursued: the matrix for

    """The dtype the direct kernels should do their arithmetic in.

    fp32, except that a small-tap kernel taking the ``tl.dot`` branch can keep
    fp16/bf16.

    The upcast this file does for bf16 and fp16 buys nothing on the dot path.
    ``tl.dot``'s products are exact either way: the operands are already bf16 or
    fp16, so their product fits an fp32 accumulator exactly whether the cube was
    handed the native dtype or its fp32 image, and only the accumulation order
    differs.  What the upcast costs is real, though -- a pass over the input, a
    pass over the output, and half again the tile traffic feeding the cube --
    and it is what the benchmark's glue kernels are: on
    (32,64,128,128)/3x3/p2 the call is 3252 us, of which 2471 is the conv kernel
    and 203 is the input upcast plus output downcast.  Keeping the native dtype
    takes that case to 1962 us, 1.66x, and is the same product for the same
    accumulator bits.

    **``taps`` is not a heuristic.**  A bf16 dot does not merely compile slowly
    where an fp32 one is merely slow -- it hangs the *device*.  Same shape, same
    kernel, only the tile dtype changed: (32,64,210,210)/k5/s2/p1 is 25 unrolled
    taps over a C_IN=64 reduction, so 50 dots in the unrolled body, and it runs
    in 10 s from a cold cache in fp32 but never returns in bf16 -- 13 minutes of
    compiler CPU and then aicore timeout 507014, the device wedged.  It is the
    same wall the 3D note below describes, reached from a different side: 9
    unrolled taps is under it, 25 is over, and bf16 lowers what a tap costs
    enough to cross it at a tap count fp32 clears.

    The FMA branch has no such excuse and must stay fp32; the Ascend backend
    does not vectorize a bf16 load feeding a multiply, and the 1D shape that
    runs in 1.06 ms in fp32 takes 87.5 ms in bf16.

    There is no shortcut for the large-tap dot cases.  The obvious move -- walk
    the taps in a runtime loop (one dot in the unrolled body, so bf16 can no
    longer hang) and keep the native dtype -- was tried on the 3-D dot arm,
    which already uses exactly that loop, and it is a *regression*, not a save:
    the 3-D shapes sit at tl.dot's minimum tile size, where the cube is latency-
    bound rather than operand-bound, so bf16's smaller operands buy nothing and
    the runtime loop loses the load/dot pipeline the unrolled 2-D form gets.
    [5]/[19]/[21] went 212 -> 507 us, 751 -> 2272 us, 170 -> 385 us with the
    dot arm handed its native dtype.  See the note in _direct_conv3d.

    For the 2-D kernel the runtime loop is a different story, and ``runtime_taps``
    (the extra flag this function takes) is how the launcher asks for it.  The
    loop itself is a win or neutral in fp32 for the split-width large-kernel
    shapes -- staggering the tap loads instead of bursting 25 at once -- and the
    one thing it changes is whether the native dtype rides along.  On the
    *non-split* path that is a win (bf16 halves the load traffic and the tile is
    not cube-saturated): [18] (16,32,32,32)/3x5/s(2,1) goes 100 -> 78 us.  On the
    *split* path it is a loss, because the loop re-derives every tap address
    through the residue arithmetic the transposed width needs, and there the
    smaller operands no longer pay for the loop: [12] (32,64,210,210)/k5/s2 goes
    8324 -> 10378 us and [8] (8,8,8192)/k11/s4 goes 83 -> 120 us when the dot arm
    is handed its native dtype.  The launcher therefore passes
    ``runtime_taps`` only when ``not split_w``.

def _pad_input(input, padding, tail):
    """Materialise the zero halo the kernels index through.

    The kernels use unpadded tap indices (``oh * SH + kh * DH``), so they need a
    tensor in which the halo already exists.  Building one costs a single pass
    over the input, and it buys the thing the alternatives cannot: the loads
    carry no mask, because a tap that falls in the halo reads a real zero --
    the padding is done by the data rather than by a compare per tap.

    That is not a stylistic choice.  The obvious way to keep a masked lane
    inside the tensor is a clamp, ``min(max(ow * SW + kw * DW - PW, 0), W - 1)``,
    and it takes the address out of the affine form the backend's axis analysis
    needs: the identical kernel then runs 160x slower -- 616 ms against 3.8 ms
    on (32,64,128,128)/k3/s2, at 97% cube utilisation either way.  See the note
    above _direct_conv2d_kernel.  Masking the load instead of clamping is closer
    -- it leaves the address alone -- but it is not free either: measured on the
    3-D shapes, on the FMA arm those shapes were running at the time, it costs
    the kernel more than the copy it saves ((2,16,16,16,16) at 226 us against
    943 us for the same kernel with ``w_ok`` on the loads).

    ``F.pad``'s two kernels are expensive for what they do and *flat* in size,
    which is why they dominate the small shapes:

        aclnnConstantPadNd_PadV3AiCore_MemSet    5.4 us
        aclnnConstantPadNd_PadV3AiCore_PadV3     7.7 us

    the same to within 0.1 us at 16 KB, 256 KB and 1 MB, against a triton
    kernel floor of 1.5 us -- while the whole call is around 30 us on the shapes
    where this matters, so the 13 us is nearly half of it.  Replacing the pair
    with triton kernels is the obvious move and it was tried twice; both were
    reverted, and the reasons are worth keeping:

    * fill then copy, two kernels: score 0.344 against the vendor pair's 0.386.
      The fill is a full pass over the *padded* buffer -- 1.4 GB on
      (32,64,210,210)/k5/s2 -- and that is the work the vendor pair does not do,
      because PadV3 writes every padded element once, interior and halo
      together.  Splitting the two makes the padding cost a pass of its own.
    * one fused kernel, one program per padded row: 0.332, and
      (32,64,128,128) went 2040 us to 16872 us.  That grid is 266240 programs
      each writing 130 columns, which is the per-row cost _pad_split_width
      measures below -- roughly 250 cycles to open a row whatever its width --
      so one row per program is the worst shape this can take.  Giving each
      program a 2-D block instead means a column range that starts at
      ``o - PW`` for the input tile, negative on the leftmost tile, and a
      masked lane still forms an address (see _slack).  That is the same wall
      the halo exists to route around, one level down.

    * copy and halo, two kernels, interior and border each in its own pass, with
      the halo run as a 3-D grid so that no index comes out of a flat division:
      score 0.367 against the vendor pair's 0.408.  It is correct -- all twelve
      shapes bit-exact against ``F.pad``, 22/22 cases -- and it is slower for a
      reason no tiling fixes.  On (32,64,512)/k3 the zeroing kernel is 64.1 us
      and the copy 24.8 us against 15.1 us for both vendor kernels together: the
      zeroing kernel stores into 4096 halo cells out of 1.57 M lanes and a masked
      store issues one lane at a time here, and the copy writes its interior as
      1 KB rows at a 2056 B stride for 242 GB/s where PadV3 does the same strided
      work *and* the border in 15.1 us.

    ``tail`` is how far past the end of a padded row the *last* output tile's
    lanes run.  Those lanes are masked at the store and their columns are
    thrown away, but they still form an address, and a masked address is still
    an address: the MTE faults on one outside the allocation before the mask is
    consulted (see _slack).  It costs nothing to give them room *inside* the
    allocation instead, by widening the padded row on the right -- the extra
    columns are zeros and no unmasked lane ever reads them.

    Callers hand this an fp32 tensor even for fp16/bf16 inputs, so the halo is
    fp32 like the accumulator.

    a run touches rather than the bytes it keeps, so that costs ``SW`` times the
    traffic, and past stride 2 the backend stops treating it as a run at all.

    ``copy_(view(...).transpose(-1, -2))`` deinterleave (a vendor Transpose).
    All three are issue-bound on their access pattern rather than bandwidth:
    measured on (32,64,210,210)/k5/s2, the Transpose runs a (Wq, SW) plane with
    SW=2 through a 2-wide transpose at ~50 GB/s where a flat copy does 400, and
    it is 3467 us of an 8297 us call -- the largest single kernel, more than the
    convolution itself.

    The halo is read as a flat (ROWS, halo_row_stride) tensor with plain
    ``tl.arange`` row and column ids and no mask or clamp.  That is a hard
    requirement of this backend: ``reshape`` + ``permute`` silently produce zero
    output whenever the tensor they fold came from a load whose index passed
    through any non-affine expression, a ``tl.minimum`` clamp even when it is a
    no-op.  _pad_split_cast widens the halo and requires ROWS to divide
    BLOCK_ROWS so these ids are always in-bounds and no clamp is needed.

    The deinterleave is ``tl.split``, not ``reshape`` + ``permute``: the latter
    is correct only on the affine load but lowers, measured here, to a 66 ms pass
    on (32,64,210,210)/k5/s2 where the same (SW, Wq) reorder through

    SW=4 nests two 2-way ``tl.split``s: folding the row into (Q, 2, 2) puts the

    even/odd and the inner split on ``a`` separates every-other, yielding the
    four planes (0, 2) and (1, 3).  Stride 4 is the only other width stride the

    One program loads a (BLOCK_C, BLOCK_W) input tile and a (BLOCK_OC, BLOCK_C)
    weight tile per tap and reuses them for BLOCK_OC * BLOCK_W outputs, so the
    load is BLOCK_C * (BLOCK_W + BLOCK_OC) elements for BLOCK_C * BLOCK_W *
    BLOCK_OC MACs -- that is, ``1/BLOCK_W + 1/BLOCK_OC`` bytes per MAC, times
    the element size.  The channel tile BLOCK_C cancels.

    ``_BLOCK_ELEMS`` bounds BLOCK_OC * BLOCK_W, so the two are alternatives and
    the split between them matters: they are symmetric in the formula but not in
    what pins them, because BLOCK_W is the output row and BLOCK_OC is capped by
    the output channels.  This takes the whole row and gives the channel tile
    only the remainder.

    That direction is the opposite of what this did, and it was a walk down the
    powers of two from the full row, taking a step whenever ``1/BLOCK_W +
    1/BLOCK_OC`` improved.  On the model above that is the same product either
    way, but the model is incomplete: it counts the bytes in a load and not the
    shape of one, and BLOCK_W is the run length.  Measured on the device, whole

    so the widest row is the fastest of the three even though each has the same
    BLOCK_C * BLOCK_W.  The walk reached (128, 64) here -- it moved one step off
    the full row because that is where the objective above first improved, and

    an FMA form at 596/610.  The cube is not far enough ahead of the vector unit
    here to pay for 16/3 the arithmetic, and it is 1.6x behind once it is.

    Only fp32 comes out ahead (502 us to 451), where the FMA chain is at its

    ``use_dot`` when the output tile is dot-sized and pins ``arith`` to fp32 --
    see the note in _direct_conv2d.

    The channel count is asked for *rounded up*, because that is the tile the

    FMA arm, where 49 taps of 12 channels are 588 rank-one updates on the
    vector unit against one padded dot per tap: 617 us to 144 us, 4.3x.

    Rounding up is only allowed to *double* the tile, i.e. c_in of 8 and above.

    kernel computes exactly the same sum -- ``sum_c W[c, oc] * x[c]`` over a W
    that is zero off the diagonal is ``w[oc] * x[oc]``.  Every product is exact
    and no term is dropped; only the order the accumulator adds them in changes.

    It costs ``groups`` times the arithmetic, which sounds like the wrong trade
    until you price the alternative.  ``groups == C_in`` collapses BLOCK_OC to 1,
    so the FMA kernel runs one output channel per program with a scalar weight
    per tap: on (16,32,56,56)/k3/g32 that is 4904 us for 462 MMAC, against
    2.36 TMAC/s for the same arithmetic on the cube -- and the same shape's

    Only the 1x1-block case is worth this: a group with more than one input or

    # or not there is padding to write.  See _pad_split_width.
    #
    # It is applied at every stride above 1, and the split on/off pair is
    # measured rather than assumed.  Same chip, same session, split against the
    # plain halo, gem device time in us:
    #
    #   [ 8] (8,8,8192)      k11 s4  1481  ->   149     10x
    #   [12] (32,64,210,210)  k5 s2  10759 -> 10021    1.07x
    #   [13] (16,32,24,24)    k3 s2   333  ->   321     1.04x  (noisy, 221-356)
    #   [ 7] (16,24,2048)     k7 s2   619  ->   616     1.00x
    #
    # so stride 4 is where it pays an order of magnitude and stride 2 is where
    # it is worth a few percent -- and re-measured on the whole call, stride 2
    # is still worth taking.  [12] without the split is 10.98 ms against 9.22
    # with it, so the conv's stride-2 penalty (5.2 ms there) exceeds the
    # transposing copy that buys it back (3.5 ms).  The clause above is right as

    # The clause that picked it was written before the row tiling above and did
    # not survive it, the same way the channel bound below did not.
    #
    # Everything else: the direct kernels above, in the dtype each of them
    # asks for.  The kernels are handed the tensor as it arrived rather than an
    # upcast image of it; _direct_conv2d/_direct_conv3d decide per kernel, and
    # only the tl.dot branch keeps the native dtype (see _arith_dtype).  Handing
    # bf16 to a kernel that is *not* on the dot path is a large loss: the kernel
    # is unchanged but bf16 makes the 1D shape that runs in 1.06 ms in fp32 take
    # 87.5 ms, because the Ascend backend does not vectorize the in-loop bf16
    # load / .to(tl.float32).  Converting once up front costs a linear pass over
    # the operands and buys that 80x back, so those paths still do it.
    #
    # Folding that conversion into the halo's copy is the obvious saving and was
    # measured: no better on any case, 4.8% worse on one.  See _pad_input.
    #
    # It also fixes a correctness hole: the shared conv1d/2d/3d kernels
    # mis-compute 1x1 kernels in every dtype (measured 18.0 absolute error in
    # fp16 and 17.99 in fp32 against an fp64 reference).  The direct kernels
    # handle 1x1 fine, so every 1x1 reaches them now, padded or not, and
    # regardless of channel count.
    #
    # There is deliberately no channel bound on this.  There used to be one --
    # the direct path was capped at C_in <= 64, on the grounds that it walks
    # C_in * KH * KW taps per output where the implicit GEMM amortizes over a
    # larger K.  That was measured against the kernel that clamped every tap to
    # stay in bounds, and materialising the halo instead removed exactly the
    # per-tap cost the bound was reasoning about.  Re-measured on the current
    # kernel (bf16, 3x3, s1, oc == C_in, (16, C_in, 56, 56)):
    #
    #   C_in      8      16      32      64     256

    # and at s2 / C_in=256, 81.7 ms against 6.14 ms (13x).  The margin grows
    # with C_in rather than shrinking -- the shared path's cost grows with it
    # while the direct path's stays flat -- so the old bound was not merely
    # stale, it was inverted: it handed the shapes with the most to gain to the
    # slower path.  Every shape measured is 12x-127x the direct path's cost,
    # which is well outside any noise that would make this a close call.
